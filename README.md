## 🎯 What is GEX?

**Gamma Exposure (GEX)** measures the total gamma held by options market makers at each strike price. It reveals where dealers are forced to buy or sell the underlying to stay hedged — creating invisible walls of support and resistance that move price.

Understanding GEX gives traders an **institutional-grade edge**:

- 🧲 **Pinning zones** — where price gets stuck
- 🧱 **Support/resistance walls** — created by dealer hedging flows
- 💥 **Volatility triggers** — where hedging flips from dampening to amplifying moves
- 🔄 **Regime shifts** — positive vs. negative gamma environments

> *Most retail traders trade against market structure. GEX traders trade* ***with*** *it.*
